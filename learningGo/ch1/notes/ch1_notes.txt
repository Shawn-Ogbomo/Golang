//CH1 LEARNING GO

-Go is a compile language

-Source code is compiled into machine code by a tool chain

-Go run compiles the source code from one of more files whose names end in.go
links them with libraries, then runs the executable file

-Go natively handles unicode, so it can process text in all the world's languages

-Go code is organized into packages which are similar to libraries or modules in other languages

-A package consists of one or more .go source files in a single directory
that define what the package does

-Each Go package begins with a package declaration

-In Go language, only import the packages that you need, else the program will
not compile
